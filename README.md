# Bookie-AI : AI-Powered Bookmark Manager

## Overview

The AI-Powered Bookmark Manager is an innovative tool designed to help users organize, categorize, and efficiently manage their bookmarks. This project evolves through three main phases, starting as a web application and ultimately becoming a browser extension.

## Features

### Phase 1: Web Application Foundation
- Bookmark Extraction: Develop a browser extension to extract all user bookmarks.
- Metadata Retrieval: Fetch metadata from bookmark URLs, with fallback mechanisms for cases where metadata is unavailable.
- Dead Link Detection: Implement functionality to identify and flag dead links through status code checks.

### Phase 2: Advanced Web Application
- AI-Powered Categorization: Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically group and categorize bookmarks based on their metadata.
- Intelligent Categorization Suggestions: Provide users with AI-generated suggestions for organizing their bookmarks.
- Smart Search Functionality: Implement a chat-like interface that allows users to find relevant bookmarks based on natural language input.

### Phase 3: Browser Extension
- Conversion to Extension: Transform the web application into a fully-functional browser extension.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure the extension works across multiple browsers.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python (for initial web application development)
- AI/ML: Large Language Models for categorization and search functionality
- Browser Extension: JavaScript

## Development Roadmap

1. Develop the initial web application with basic bookmark management features.
2. Integrate AI capabilities for advanced categorization and search.
3. Convert the web application to a browser extension, leveraging AI tools to translate Python code to JavaScript as needed.
